“Facebook's outage appears to be caused by DNS; however that's a just symptom of the problem,” says Troy Mursch, chief research officer of cyberthreat intelligence company Bad Packets. The fundamental issue, Mursch says—and other experts agree—is that Facebook has withdrawn the so-called Border Gateway Protocol route that contains the IP addresses of its DNS nameservers. If DNS is the internet’s phone book, BGP is its navigation system; it decides what route data takes as it travels the information superhighway.
